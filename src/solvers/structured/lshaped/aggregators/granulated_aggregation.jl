    GranulatedAggregation

Functor object for using partial aggregation in an L-shaped algorithm. Create by supplying a [`GranulatedAggregate`](@ref) object through `aggregate` in `LShaped.Optimizer` or by setting the [`Aggregator`](@ref) attribute.

# Parameters
- `size::Int`: Number of cuts in each aggregate
